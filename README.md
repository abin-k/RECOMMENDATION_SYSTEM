Developed a content based Music recommendation systems based on cosine similarity and TF-IDF vectorizer. 

Cosine similarity is a mathematical technique that measures the similarity between two vectors. In the context of music recommendation, cosine similarity can be used to compare a user's listening history with the music in a database and generate recommendations based on the similarity between the user's listening history and the music in the database.

TF-IDF vectorizer is used to convert song into a vector representation that can be used to compute similarity scores between songs.
TF-IDF vectorizer is a powerful tool for music recommendation as it allows for a quantitative analysis of the songs and can help identify songs with similar themes and subject matter.
